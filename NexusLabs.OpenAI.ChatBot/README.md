# NexusLabs.OpenAI.ChatBot
A C# API for working with a chat bots. This work was initially inspired by 
David Shapiro who has been actively sharing his prototyping efforts on a 
chatbot called RAVEn. While David's work is written in Python, this library 
initially started as a C# port of the approach he had created. Inevitably,
there will be drifts between his work and what we see in this library because:
1) Different languages
2) Different repositories

However, it is important to state that his efforts were the inspiration.
