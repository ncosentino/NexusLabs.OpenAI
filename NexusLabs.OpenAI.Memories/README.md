# NexusLabs.OpenAI.Memories
A C# API for working with a concept of offline "memories" with respect to AI 
models. This work was initially inspired by David Shapiro who has been actively
sharing his prototyping efforts on a chatbot called RAVEn. While David's work
is written in Python, this library initially started as a C# port of the
approach he had created. Invevitably, there will be drifts between his work and
what we see in this library because:
1) Different languages
2) Different repositories
However, it is important to state that his efforts were the inspiration.
