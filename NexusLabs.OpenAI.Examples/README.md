# NexusLabs.OpenAI.Examples
This project has a handful of examples to demonstrate how you can work with 
the NexusLabs.OpenAI projects. You will need to configure your 
launchSettings.json file to provide your API key for OpenAI if you would like
to try out the examples. You can see an example_launchSettings.json file
included in the project structure that you can use as a basis.

When you run this project, you will be presented with a console window. In the
console, you can enter the name of an example to run (easiest to copy+paste the
example name).
